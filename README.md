## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I encountered while building the app were:
* Using DOM manipulation is still a bit confusing to me so I had to look up various resources to understand how to use it.
* The various javascript concepts, destructuring and the spread operator, were a bit confusing to me. I never used it before so I had to play around with it to understand how it works.
* I understand how to use template literals in a string, but I wasn't aware that I had to use the backticks instead of single and double quotes.
* Working with CSS is still a quite hard for me as I know how I want the page to look like, but I have to play around with the CSS to get it to look the way I want it to. Most of the time the style breaks when I try to change something else.
